I am a first year PhD student at TU Wien, advised by [Thomas Gärtner](https://thomasgaertner.org/).

Most recently, I was a research assistant at Aalto University in the group led by [Vikas Garg](https://www.aalto.fi/en/people/vikas-kumar-garg) (QuML: [https://quml.aalto.fi/about-us/](https://quml.aalto.fi/about-us/)).  
Before that, I worked on interval-based embeddings for signed interaction graphs during a research internship at TU Wien supervised by [Stefan Neumann](https://neumannstefan.com/) (TU Wien Machine Learning Research Unit: [https://ml-tuw.github.io/](https://ml-tuw.github.io/)).

My research interests include:

- **Robustness & verification:** probabilistic guarantees for ML systems
- **Generative models:** diffusion models and compositional modeling (incl. fuzzy logic)
- **Networks & structured data:** graph-based representations and opinion dynamics

I also do applied work in medical data analysis at the Karl Landsteiner Institute for Outpatient Rehabilitation, focused on predictive modeling and outcomes analysis in rehabilitation.

You can find more details in my [CV](/cv/) and [publications](/publications/).
